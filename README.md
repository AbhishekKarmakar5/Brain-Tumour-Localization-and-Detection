# Brain-Tumour-Localization-and-Detection

Normally a brain tumor generation takes place due to massive growth of abnormal tissues or cells in the
brain or from the spinal cord of the human body. Many brain tumors are caused to disrupt the function of
the brain activity. However others are less harmful. Brain tumors are basically either cancerous
(malignant) or benign (non cancerous). Benign refers to the cancerous whereas malignant refers to the
non-cancerous portion of the brain tumour. By definition, malignant tumors are more aggressive than
benign tumors and it can spread rapidly and has a tremendous growth on other brain portions. 

In case of benign tumors, the mass or sac of cells abnormal in nature, does not contain any cancer cell. The rate at
which they grow is very slow and they stick to a particular rather than spreading and are also way more
common than malignant tumors. Whereas the malignant brain tumors do contain cancer cells and they
scatter. These can grow rapidly and spread to other parts of the brain, which makes them lethal.

In fact, according to the ABTA (American Brain Tumor Association), as per the information, around
two-thirds of all new brain tumors are benign category that is sixty-six to sixty-seven percent and the ACS
(American Cancer Society) group, facted the statistics for the brain consisting of tumors and with those
for tumors of the spinal cord. The details of each type of tumor has a different range of characteristics and
they even have different subtypes, and also a tumor may consist of more than one type of cell and regions.

Here we have used various image processing techniques and a convolution neural network for the
detection, localization and 3D Feature visualization of the tumor features in the brain.
